# Forest_Fire_Predictor
Forest Fire Occurrence Probability is predicted using Machine Learning.

Models used- train_test_split and LogisticRegression

Modules used- Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, Pickle, Warnings

Technologies used- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Pycharm

Model is trained using logistic regression and is dumped in a pickle file. It is then Deployed in web using Flask. Three Attributes are taken into consideration: Temperature, Oxygen and Humidity. After submitting the values, output is generated showing the probability of occurrence of forest fire for given values.

Model's accuracy can be further increased by using a csv file with more dataset.
